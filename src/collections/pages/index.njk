    <h2 class="site-title">The path to feeling better</h2>
    <p>When we feel down or we’re at our most anxious moments, there are heaps of things we can do to help us feel better again. Doing these things can help prevent everyday mood swings from developing into mental health disturbances, such as depression and anxiety.</p>
    <p>No matter what it is you are going through, we believe in every person’s inherent ability to heal. At times, a catalyst is needed to access your healing or breakthrough in your journey.</p>
    <p>The Juju Room’s plethora of psychedelic medicine might just be the catalyst that you need.</p>
